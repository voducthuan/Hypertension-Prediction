# HypertensionPredict
Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) is one of the most common diseases in modern societies. Regardless of race, age, or gender, anyone can develop high blood pressure. According to the NIH Nation Institutes of Health, High blood pressure increases your chance (or risk) for getting heart disease and/or kidney disease, and for having a stroke. 
Although this disease is especially dangerous and often has no warning signs or symptoms, we can prevent and control high blood pressure by taking action. How to do that? According to medical specialists, we must know the common causes of disease and adjust life-style so that we can reduce the risk of being hypertension.
To have a good diagnosis, we must obtain some medical tests and experts but these conditions are not always possible. Observations may be uncertain or missing. Therefore, Bayesian network is a reasonable technique for disease diagnosis problem. By combining knowledge of Bayesian network, data mining and experience of medical experts, we can build a system help discover main factors relating to hypertension and how these factors are related by probabilities. 

This system had used Bayesian Network to helps everyone have a reliable analysis (Predicable) on Hypertension about her/his risks of being hypertension as well as offer good suggestions for their health status.
